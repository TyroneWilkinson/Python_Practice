def minimumBribes(Q):

    #
    # decrease Q by 1 to make index-matching more intuitive
    # so that our values go from 0 to N-1, just like our
    # indices.  (Not necessary but makes it easier to
    # understand.)

        # ahead of P.  P's original position is the value
        # of P.
        # Anyone who bribed P cannot get to higher than
        # one position in front of P's original position,

        # of P's original position to one in front of P's
        # current position, and see how many of those 
        # positions in Q contain a number large than P.
        # In other words we will look from P-1 to i-1,
        # which in Python is range(P-1,i-1+1), or simply
        # range(P-1,i).  To make sure we don't try an
        # index less than zero, replace P-1 with
        # max(P-1,0)
